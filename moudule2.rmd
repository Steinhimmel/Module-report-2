# Limitation about this data

***

#### Random sample? Having Bias?
There are 325 students enrolled in DATA2002/2902 in the second semester 2018. The respond rate is not that high, hence the margin of error can be quite high. In this case, we tend to think the sample is not randomly chosen from the whole population.

The data was collected through on-line survey on ed platform,it is likely to cause Non-response bias to sample result. Students who answered the survey are possibly those took DATA2002/2902 more seriously, joining campus life more activily and  spend more time on study platform(ed). That might affect result to survey questions like: number of being member of school clubs, study time per week, time on social media platform and so on. Considering that, this sample can not be viewed as random or representative for the whole population. 

Except collection bias, some survey questions are likely to cause measurement bias. For example: when people answering to the question: "how often do you floss your teeth(floss_frequency)" and "average hour spend on school work last semester(study)", they may fail to answer accurately and truthfully. This can result in inaccurate conclusion. Other vaiables like "the last time to see dentist(dentist)" and "favourite social media(social_media)" might also subjected to measurement bias. 

#### Missing Value
```{r include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
datf = as.data.frame(data)
datf %>%
gather(col_name,value)%>%
group_by(col_name)%>%
tally(is.na(value)) %>%
  kable()%>%
  kable_styling(position = "center",bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed"))
```
- There is a large number of missing values in â€œidentifierâ€? column probably because this question is too vague. Students don't know whether they should answer this question with their SID or something else. 
- Other columns have a small proportion of missing value so it is safe to remove the data with missing values.
